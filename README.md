## Overview

This project is a custom-built Pomodoro timer application crafted to enhance productivity and time management skills. The Pomodoro technique, a renowned time management method, involves breaking work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes long, separated by short breaks. This app offers a digital solution to implement this technique effectively.

The primary objective of this project was to create an intuitive, user-friendly Pomodoro timer that not only helps users focus on tasks but also provides them the flexibility to customize timer durations and the application's appearance. The app features a dynamic circular progress bar that visually represents the passage of time, enhancing the user experience by offering real-time feedback.

This project's critical aspect was ensuring smooth and responsive functionality across different devices, along with customizable user preferences for a more personalized experience. The app's design emphasizes minimalism and ease of use while providing robust functionality and customization options.

## Features

Users of this Pomodoro app can:

- Start a Pomodoro timer and short and long break timers to manage their work and break periods effectively.
- Customize the duration of each timer according to their personal productivity rhythm.
- View a circular progress bar that updates every minute, visually indicating the remaining time in the current interval.
- Personalize the app's appearance by setting preferences for colors and fonts, making the user interface more enjoyable and tailored to individual tastes.

## Tech Stack

This application was developed using a contemporary and efficient tech stack, focusing on both performance and user experience:

- Vite (React & TypeScript): Used for its fast build tool that improves the development workflow with features like hot module replacement. React for building user interfaces and TypeScript for adding type safety, enhancing code quality, and maintainability.
- NextUI: Chosen for its beautiful and modern UI components that are easily customizable, contributing to the appâ€™s sleek and user-friendly interface.
- Tailwind CSS: Implemented for its utility-first approach, allowing rapid UI development with consistent styling across the application.
- Zustand: Utilized for its simplicity and efficiency in state management, enabling the app to maintain a reactive and consistent state without the complexity of other state management libraries.
- React Hook Form: Employed to manage forms in the app, streamlining the process of gathering and validating user input for customization settings.

The architecture of this application was meticulously planned to ensure scalability and ease of adding new features in the future, with a focus on a clean and maintainable codebase.
